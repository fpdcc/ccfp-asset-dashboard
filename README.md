## Developing

Development requires a local installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Build application containers:

```
docker-compose build
```

Load the dummy data for development:
```
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py load_development_data
```

Run the app:

```
docker-compose up
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8000. The database will be exposed
on port 32001.

Run the app with a debugger:
```
docker-compose run --rm -p 8000:8000 app
```

### Compiling Sass to CSS

This project uses Sass to compile a custom Bootstrap build with house styles.
Making changes to the Sass? Use our `develop` script to auto-compile your
changes to CSS and commit your changes.

```bash
# On a running app container
docker-compose exec app npm run-script develop

# OR, in a one-off container
docker-compose run --rm app npm run-script develop

# Add your changes to version control
git add asset_dashboard/static/css/bootstrap.custom.css
git commit -m "Update custom Bootstrap build"
```

Note that you only need to update the Sass to override base Bootstrap styles.
See [the Bootstrap documentation on theming](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/theming/)
for more information.

To extend Bootstrap styles and add new styles, edit `app.css` directly.

### Running tests

Run tests with Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tests/docker-compose.yml run --rm app
```
